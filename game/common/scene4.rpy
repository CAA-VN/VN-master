    "We walk for a few more minutes before reaching a flat grass clearing surrounded by grand buildings."

    "On one side of the grass is a massive building with classical pillars and windows about three stories tall."

    "On the top reads \"The Bell Library.\""

    "There are a few people lounging on the grass and a frisbee flying through the air between two people."

    "I bet these are normal midday activities since the lawn is so huge."

    "You could play a game of soccer at a field of this size."

    "I wonder how many students can fit on this grassy area all at once? Have they ever tried to fit the whole campus in here?"

    d "Look out!"

    p "Huh?"

    "I notice a circular pattern on the ground of the path Rosa and I are walking on, but it’s so worn out that I can barely make out the image."

    "My foot is hovering just above it."

    d "Wow. You nearly ended your entire college career just now."

    d "That’s a seal. They’re everywhere on campus if you look at the floors."

    p "Why’d you tell me to \"watch out\" for it, though?"

    "Rosa opens her mouth to speak but notices a group of about ten students walking in our direction."

    "They are all preoccupied with talking to each other."

    d "Just watch this."

    "Rosa and I move to the side of the road while remaining right next to the seal."

    "We can hear some of their conversation."

    "\"Yeah, our dance club is being really tough with their practice times... have you all sold your tickets to the show yet?\""

    "..."

    "\"Zero percent sugar in boba with pudding for life. Spare Tea is godlike—\""

    "The students are walking normally but suddenly split into two groups."

    "Half of the students avoid the seal on the ground by going left, while the other half went right."

    "Their conversation halts and picks back up a moment later, reforming their group."

    "They completely avoided the same seal I was about to step on."

    "They pass by and I turn to Rosa."

    p "What the heck was that?"

    d "It’s just another odd thing you’ll see on campus."

    d "We might be a prestigious university, but we still have our superstitions."

    "Superstition? I never expected to see it in action in the middle of the day like that."

    p "What do you mean by superstition?"

    d "Stepping on our school’s seals on campus is considered bad luck."

    d "You’ll never see a student step on one of those, even when they’re tired after a midterm."

    d "The seals commemorate the university’s previous graduating classes, so you’d really be stepping on the souls of successful people..."

    d "Not that I haven’t stepped on a seal or two."

    "Rosa laughs."

    d "Based on my own experience... I wouldn’t take the chance. If you catch my drift."

    "I never would have expected such an old curse to be marked right onto the surface of the school. What’s going on here?"

    "My parents never told me about this part of the school— did they ever step on a seal?"

    p "Are the students really expected to follow that norm here?"

    "Rosa laughs and puts her hands on her hips."

    d "Maybe it just rubs off on them from orientation."

    d "There’s also this grassy hill on the other side of campus where students roll themselves down at full speed..."

    d "...It’s supposed to be a charm to keep your GPA high."

    d "A lot of clubs in school take their newbies to that hill and roll ‘em down."

    d "Supposedly, that good luck is reversed if you happen to step on a seal."

    "What a mysterious place this university is turning out to be."

    "Is it normal for a campus to do this?"

    "For an educational institution, there is a lot of intuition and instinct that goes into something as simple as walking."

    d "Don’t think too hard about it. Think about it like the whole campus agreed to play a little game."

    d "For half a century."

    "We walk onto the large, grassy clearing in the heart of campus."

    "Although I can’t see the edges of campus, the sky opens up compared to the tunnel vision of walking between buildings."

    "Six paths converge into this area from different parts of campus, and I can look down the path of each for quite a ways. All paths lead here."

    "It’s as if this is the only place to see the sky on campus: no trees, no buildings, for just a short stretch of land."

    d "Welcome to Memory Glade. It’s really just a big lawn, but this is one of the most important places on campus."

    d "Our Chancellor pays the big bucks to keep this place clean. Except for a certain day of the year..."

    "One of the buildings reads \"Bell Library\" in large letters etched onto the stone, decorated with accompanying pillars."

    "My eyes light up."

    "This is more of what I expected."

    "This place emanates studiousness, prestige, and the promise in that letter I received."

    d "What’s the first thing you see when you look up our campus online?"

    p "Huh?"

    "Looking at the green grass sprawled in front of me, the stone buildings with mile-high ceilings and glass panes beaming down at me, I realize that this place is familiar."

    "This is the very first image you see of this place."

    "It shows up on the school website, and all of the advertisements in the mail proudly displayed Memory Glade."

    "I can see the students casually striding up and down these paths."

    "Although the campus is still asleep, I bet thousands of students pass by this area once the semester kicks in."

    p "It’s like this place is the heart of campus."

    "I can see the ventricles, the aorta, and the blood that travels through this place."

    "From here, campus seems more like a microcosm than a walled garden."

    "Rosa laughs."

    d "You would do well in English. I can tell you that much."

    "Really?"

    d "This place isn’t the heart of campus to me. It might be the center of it, but this is something else."

    d "I think this is the face of our school."

    "I try to process what she might mean, but Rosa moves a few steps into the grass and points up at the sky past the library."

    d "And then there’s... that."

    "Rosa points at a large monolith sitting right behind the library’s tall facade."

    "Although I didn’t notice it at first, the sheer height of the tower makes it more noticeable now."

    "I only realize now that it’s probably in view everywhere on campus, even if it’s just the top."

    "A massive, stone clock tower ticking away."

    "I’m sure you’ve heard it a thousand times since you woke up this morning. Did you find it comforting?"

        d "I see. Well, that’s all up to you for now. I’m just wondering what a freshman might see the first time."

        d "It’s stood there for more years than we’ve been alive, combined."

        d "I remember seeing it from down the road, ticking away."

        d "Tick, tock, tick tock. Ahh, Bentham."

        d "It should be ringing in just a few minutes, which also means this is the end of our tour..."

        d "I’m sorry that this tour was so quick."

        "Rosa takes me back down the same road we went by."

        "This time, I was careful to avoid the seal."

        "Rosa subconsciously avoided it, as if she had done it for years."

        d "I’m not the best upperclassman for this."

        "She rattles off a few names of buildings that we pass by, but doesn’t offer any more information."

        "I quickly forget the names."

        "She’s completely right, but I don’t want her to beat herself up about it."

        "I’m just a freshman, maybe I don’t know what it means to be a busy student yet."

        p "You probably have a ton of things to do. It’s your last year here, after all."

        "Rosa grins as she folds the stack of papers she’s been holding."

        "First, into one half, then into another half, and so on until she shoves the whole thing into her back pocket."

        "After all that time keeping them straightened out?"

        d "Right. You’re right."

        d "Busy girl."

        "She stretches her arms backward before letting them go limp, resting them at her side."

        "She looks more relaxed than ever, now that the tour is over."

        d "We’ll be meeting back here. I’m going to walk you all to the Chancellor’s big speech."

        d "Enjoy your free hour! There’s plenty of time to get to know the campus."

        "After stretching and making sure I know the rest of today’s schedule, Rosa winks at me."

        d "I’m such a mess."

        d "I owe you one."

        "She turns back towards the university, leaving me back where I first saw her."

        "She looks a lot taller walking away."

        "I can see the shoddy folding done on her orientation papers— they’re lazily tucked into her back pocket."

        "In her other pocket is a small, square object, but I can’t tell what it is from here."

        "She takes a quick left from the bridge and disappears behind a mass of trees."

        "I head towards Golden Bell Cafe."

        "If I have a free hour before the speech, then I’m going to eat!"

        "As I’m heading to the cafe, I fumble for my wallet."

        "I find nothing but empty air inside. I must have left it when I was rushing down today..."

        "What a mess for my very first day here. I wonder what my parents would think of silly little me."

        "The food inside looks so good."

        "The neon sign is not an invitation any more, it’s a taunt to my stomach. A symbol of my woes."

        "My stomach grumbling, I head back to the gate."

        "I refuse to head back to the dorms now."

        "If I can’t eat now, then I’ll just have to survive the rest of the day."

        "Then I’ll be free to eat to my heart’s desire."
