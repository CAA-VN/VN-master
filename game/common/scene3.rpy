    "Cora and Vi quickly find their orientation leader, setting off on their own introduction to the university. They’ve left me in a mob of freshmen, all waiting for their own leaders to show up."
    
    "A few “Excuse me, is this Group 6?” inquiries later, I finally find my orientation group. However, it seems like everyone in the group has already formed their own circles, probably because I was with Cora and Vi for so long."
    
    "At ten minutes past the hour though, only my group is left waiting around at the school’s large gate."
    
    "While the others are talking away in their newfound cliques, I decide to pull out my phone and check the news. It might be handy to learn a bit more about this place on a day-to-day basis."
    
    "I love living in this day and age. No one will confront you for checking your phone or even being on it at all times. It’s like an invisibility cloak."

    "I look up from my phone. My orientation leader still hasn’t shown up and the other freshmen around me are looking antsy. They seem young even if they are just about the same age as me."
    
    "No one is even remotely near us. Since the other orientation groups left, we look like a lost group of high schoolers who wandered onto this university campus."
    
    "Ten more minutes and I’m about to leave. Although I wouldn’t have much to do for the rest of the day, I’d rather not waste time on waiting for an older student who lacks punctuality."
    
    "I could go back to the dorms for now and walk around the main street and see what the city looks like at night. There were a lot of dormant neon signs as I walked with Cora and Vi to this meeting place, so it might be interesting to see what kind of shops they are."
    
    "Exploring the campus at night sounds exciting. There are a lot of places to wander and just get lost between buildings and twisting paths through groves."
    
    "I glance back down at my phone, only to see the headline for the next article on the list."
    
    "“Don’t Go Outside! Bell University Crime Rates Soaring!!”"
    
    "..."
    
    "Suddenly, walking around at night doesn’t sound so great. Bell University may be a top school, but the area around the campus seems more dangerous than expected."
    
    "According to this article, there’s a whole mess of “red zone” areas that surround the campus on all four sides. These areas are the supposed crime hotspots."
    
    "Sticking to campus and the dorms might be the only way to stay safe for now. There were quite a few groups of homeless people when I was with Cora and Vi too."
    
    "I’m pulled away from reading the article when I notice two members from my orientation group walking away. They must have become fed up with waiting as I hear a few grumbles about “lunch.”"
    
    "I keep my eyes on my phone screen. I overhear the other freshmen mentioning that they might head to the next event on the schedule in two hours, a classwide meeting with the Chancellor."
    
    "The ten minutes are almost up and students are trickling away to explore on their own, either in groups of two or three. This tour obviously isn’t going to happen."
    
    "I wonder how Cora and Vi are doing with their group? They must be having fun. They seemed excited about the dinosaur fossils on display in one of the university libraries."
    
    "I should ask them later."
    
    "For now, I need to find something to eat. I’m standing at the gate of campus, alone, for apparently no reason, and I haven’t even had breakfast. And in a few seconds, it’ll be ten..."

    "A tall woman with puffy blonde hair stops just short of where I’m standing, catching her breath from under the large, green gate. As she runs/stumbles towards my direction, she clutches a stack of wrinkled papers in one hand, while keeping herself steady by holding her knee with her other hand."
    
    "She's not showing the same fatigue on her face as the rest of her body. Instead, she givees a big grin."
    
    p "Are you the Group Six orientation leader?"
    
    d "That would be me. My name's Rosa."
    
    "Despite the shaky introduction, Rosa looks well-dressed and a lot older than the other students I’ve seen, even compared to the other orientation leaders. Is she… a graduate student?"
    
    "Her face is well sculpted and has lost the baby fat in her cheeks. And even at this distance, I can tell that she’s wearing strong rose perfume. What’s under it?"

    "She finally stands up after having gulped some air. She straightens her shirt out and takes a moment to compose herself."
    
    d "I’m pretty late, huh."
    
    d "Well, there’s no need to sweat the small stuff."
    
    d "It seems like you’re the good egg of the bunch, sticking around for so long. How about we get this tour started and you can tell me a bit more about yourself, okay?"
    
    "I don’t have the heart to tell Rosa that I was just a few seconds away from leaving. The main street, however, is quite long, and I can see down the end of it for quite a ways. I might be able to see the Gate even when I’m at the end of this road."
    
    "There are trees lining both sides of the path, and I feel a sense of grandeur in its utopian architecture."
    
    "Rosa walks past me and places herself between me and the heart of campus, just a bit up the road from the orientation meeting point."
    
    "Just a little further ahead, I see a main road with several intersecting paths winding their way up and down the hills. Some of them look impossible to walk straight on."
    
    "Rosa keeps checking her papers every few seconds. Could she be worrying about the other freshmen who disappeared? They can’t possibly get into that much trouble in just an hour."
    
    d "Right… This is the main street of campus, Sprout Plaza. You’ll probably walk by here at least once a day on the way to classes."
    
    d "If you look just over your shoulder over there..."
    
    "I turn around and there’s a small building with some tables for eating, just off of Sprout Plaza. There are umbrellas for shade, and a few metal chairs are fixed to the ground on the side."
    
    d "You can see Bell Cafe. Students go there to get smoothies, snacks, or even lunch. You can spend your Meal Points in there. It’s pretty convenient that it’s closer to the center of campus than the restaurants."
    
    "Meal Points. Students use them at the dining halls around campus and near the dormitory areas, but I had no clue I could buy other things with them. A smoothie does sound pretty good right now…"
    
    "There’s no way I could spend all of my points this semester. No human could consume that much food in three months."
    
    "It must be fairly convenient to eat at these cafes before hoofing it to class like a mountain goat up these hills."
    
    d "It's definitely not worth it, though. Trust me."
    
    "Rosa nods her head approvingly. She notices several students going in and out of the cafe, through the large double doors out front. There’s a neon green “Open” sign on the door."
    
    "Those students all look tired and gaunt even though it’s only the start of the day."
    
    p "“Isn’t it supposed to be summer right now? What are those students doing here?” More importantly, why do they all look so tired?"
    
    d "Those students probably just finished their summer classes. Some people are crazy enough to stay here during their only vacation of the year. And some students unfortunately have to do it, if they want to graduate."
    
    d "I probably won’t be the last person you hear this from. This school is home to some of the craziest human beings on Earth. The work ethic here is off the charts...phew."
    
    "Rosa puts her hand to her forehead. She talks to herself under her breath, and I barely catch what she says under her stack of papers. “But that’s not a fitting environment for everyone…”"
    
    "She’s been rubbing her forehead ever since we started the tour, and I notice that her eyes look just as fatigued. Is everyone here so overworked?"
    
    "She notices that I'm still listening, and she goes right back to her cheery smile."
    
    d "But they're even crazier to be eating there of all places."
    
    d "The food used to be a lot better back when I was a freshman. A foodie’s dream place. Chicken strips, cheese fries, burgers...cough, cough."
    
    "Rosa lets out a few coughs."
    
    d "What I wouldn’t do for a bottle of water right now."
    
    d "No meal points for this relic of the past though."
    
    "Rosa drifts off before snapping back to reality a few seconds later. She also looks hungry."
    
    d "Anyway, let’s move on. You can come back here around lunchtime and check it out for yourself."
    
    "We’re still standing under the gate, my focus coming back to the bricks and stone that we’re standing on. Rosa walks towards one of the sides of the bridge and calls me over with a wave of her hand."
    
    d "Come check this out."
    
    d "Right under the gate is a cute little creek, actually. We’re technically standing on a bridge… although most people here are too busy to notice a neat detail like that."
    
    d "Just take a look over the edge for a second."
    
    "I walk toward the stone railing on one side of the bridge, just past the large gate. I hear the sound of running water grow stronger as I approach the edge. I finally get close enough to look over."
    
    "Right under this massive structure is a creek with a small bed of stones on either side. There are trees overhanging both sides, which makes the area look wild and unkempt. The branches are hanging low and I can see some graffiti on the base of several trees."
    
    "There's quite a bit of litter lying around the creek though."
    
    "It looks like people can go down there, but based on my first impressions, I might want to stay away. Compared to the squeaky clean masonry up here, it’s a completely different world down there."
    
    "Rosa’s eyes are glossy as they drift around the area. She coughs again and closes her eyes."
    
    d "I always found it a bit ironic that something as pretty as this is hiding under the school’s surface. It’s so… exhilarating, don’t you think so?"
    
    "Rosa’s eyes are lighting up brightly, even more than when she was smiling just a few moments ago. Does she really see something beautiful down there?"
    
    p "That’s not the first word I would use..."
    
    "Rosa looks upset after hearing what I said. Her face is set like stone."
    
    d "That's unfortunate."
    
    d "Let's move on."
    
    "Rosa takes me further into campus through the long road. The rows of trees look like they never end, and although the road is quite dirty in the corners, there’s still majesty to the whole path. I feel like I’m walking on hallowed grounds."
    
    "Then I see a few students zooming by on bright, blue-aluminum scooters. Expensive headphones. The newest fashion trends. Dyed hair. One student zooms by on an electric-powered skateboard."
    
    "What are these new-fashioned people doing in such an old-fashioned place? Rosa pays them no mind and walks on."
    
    "The bricks are jig-jagged and there are plenty of shady areas provided by the numerous tall trees in the area. I see many squirrels walking along the branches, and the trees gently shake every few seconds."
    
    "Rosa is shuffling through her papers with a lazy yawn."
    
    d "Haaaaaaaa."
    
    d "Okay. We’re headed down this way. I only have time to show you a few things, so I’m taking you to the vital ones."
    
    "I don’t have a choice, just like I don’t have a choice about who my leader is. I could make my way back to the Gate myself, but that would be more counterproductive than just going along for the ride."
    
    p "Okay."
    
    d "Nothing to say about that?"
    
    "I have a few things to say, but maybe not one to an upperclassmen of mine. I know almost nothing about her. I should stay quiet."
    
    p "Not particularly."
    
    "Rosa shakes her head and laughs, as if I had said something incredulous."
    
    d "You're a bit of a pushover, you know that?"
    
    "Rosa walks on and I pay attention to the changing colors of the leaves around me. Some of them are starting to glow orange instead of green."
    
    "The natural setting on campus is fairly nice and a bit unexpected. From the outside, the campus just looks like modern building after modern building."
    
    "Someone could easily get lost just looking up into the trees."
