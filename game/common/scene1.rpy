    "It’s early in the morning, a bit colder than I’m used to back home. Just by standing in this room, I can feel the shivers crawling up my skin."

    "The car ride up here last night was only a few hours, but the whole day before was spent packing everything. I was too excited thinking about living in a new place. I couldn’t fall asleep until three in the morning."

    "I wonder if I’m the only freshman who felt weird packing a suitcase for the first time or loading up a car with what will be “my entire life.”"

    "It’s still early but according to the time schedule, I’ve already missed the free breakfast. It was supposed to be provided downstairs in the dining hall at 7 AM, advertised with soft pancakes and savory bacon."

    "Luckily, I packed a few emergency snacks; it’ll have to do for now."

    "The light creeps through my blinds, shining right onto my face. The windows to my room are exceedingly large, taking up nearly an entire wall with thick glass. I can only think this annoying light will be on a daily basis."

    "The room is also very large. I could definitely accommodate a few guests in here without it feeling too cramped. There are only a few rooms in the dorms as big as this one."

    "I know this only because I couldn’t help but sneak a few peeks into other people’s rooms while walking through the hallway."

    "Having to think about “my” luggage or “my” room feels odd to me. I unpacked all of my luggage into this room––one that I haven’t stayed in long enough to feel at home––last night. And while the bed is comfy, it still feels strange and unfamiliar."

    "It’s my stuff in a borrowed room, so clean that it feels alien. That’s all it is for now."

    "In fact, my room only has the essentials. Half of the closet is full of my clothes and I’ve lazily stuffed office supplies into the provided desk."

    "I move to the large windows and pull the blinds, letting the sunlight fill up the room and give it a little life. The off-white walls make the room shiny and reflective, giving the place a cheery and modern look. At the very least, it looks very clean. "

    "There are corkboards on both sides of the room for hanging up papers or photos. Maybe I’ll make a collage when I have the time."

    "Zzz! Zzz!"

    "My phone starts to vibrate in my pocket. It’s early in the morning so I know it can only be one of two people calling me."

    "I read the name in large, bold letters on the center of my phone screen. “Mom.” I swipe my finger to answer the call."

    $ phone.call('Mom')

    p "Morning, mom."

    $ phone.receive_message("Hi, sweetie. Are you all set for orientation? Got everything you need?")

    "I take a quick glance at my room and note that I still have some shopping to do later."

    p "I’ll be okay for now. I finished unpacking already."

    "I do my best to sound cheery even though the past few hours have felt a bit lonely. All I did was watch videos on my phone until I fell asleep."

    $ phone.receive_message("You know, they didn’t even have an orientation week when your father and I were freshmen.")

    $ phone.receive_message("They just put us into our dorms and sent us to class the very next day.")

    $ phone.receive_message("Of course, your father and I didn’t know each other at the time.")

    $ phone.receive_message("I really miss those days. You’re a lucky one.")

    "I’ve heard the story a million times, but my mom always loves to tell it anyway. Bell University is a very special place for them. They always told me that this place was magical."

    p "It’s only been a few hours, mom."

    $ phone.receive_message("I know, but I’m just so excited for you! College was the best time of our lives.")

    $ phone.receive_message("I’m sure it’ll be all the same for you.")

    $ phone.receive_message("Whatever your heart desires, kiddo.")
    
    $ phone.receive_message("It’s there on campus. I promise.")
    
    $ phone.receive_message("You just need the tenacity to chase after it.")
    
    $ phone.receive_message("Reach for it. You’re my child, after all.")

    $ phone.receive_message("That’s how I know you can do this and that you won’t fail.")

    p "..."

    "I stay quiet on my end of the line. I don’t want to tell her how nervous that makes me."

    "What if I don’t get the same, happy story? What if there are too many bumps on the road?"

    "My parents mean well when they tell me stories about their perfect life here on this campus, but it makes me worry about my own path, which is still unclear even to me. "

    "And I have no idea how to advance."

    "After a moment of silence, mom speaks again."

    $ phone.receive_message("I know you haven’t picked a major just yet, but…")

    p "Mom."

    "She clears her throat. We had tried to talk about this over the summer but the subject always went cold. When I looked into her eyes, I know that she wants the best for me, but is too afraid to pressure me into a decision."

    "Although I still feel the pressure regardless."

    $ phone.receive_message("I have to go now, sweetie. Call me every now and then, okay?")

    p "Okay, mom, I will. And…"

    p "... I’m going to find something that’s worth chasing. I promise. That’s why I’m here, like you’ve always told me."

    p "College will be perfect."

    $ phone.receive_message("Mmhmm. That’s what I like to hear.")

    "Her voice crackles on the static and it occurs to me that she is farther away than ever."

    $ phone.receive_message("Love you. Call me soon.")

    $ phone.hangup()

    "I hang up, feeling like I just told a small fib that I need to fix and make as true as I can."

    "But right now, the morning must go on."

    "I look out the big window, sticking my face close to the glass. I see a blur of students coming out of their dorm buildings and heading in the direction of campus. That is when I hear feet shuffling in the main hallway outside of my door."

    "It crosses my mind to look at the flyer that was left on “my” desk. The desk in question is placed at the foot of my bed, and my roommate has one at the foot of theirs."

    "I pick up the flyer to gaze upon its contents:"

    nvl clear

    nvl_n "SCHEDULE:"

    nvl_n "Breakfast: 7 AM"

    nvl_n "Meet Your Leader: 9 AM"

    nvl_n "Campus Tour: 10 AM"

    "I quickly throw on a hoodie. I’m hungry, but since I’m still unfamiliar with the area and I would rather not wander aimlessly."

    "I do have a schedule to follow today, so hang in there, stomach."

    "Golden Bell Orientation starts today. New students move into the dorms one week before classes start in order to tour the campus and the surrounding areas, and get their bearings."

    "It’s advertised as a week of meeting new people while learning about your new community as a fellow Bell."

    "Someone starts knocking on the door from across the room, breaking my train of thought."

    "“Orientation is starting in ten minutes!” an unfamiliar voice calls out while slipping a piece of paper under my door. It’s the same flyer that is already on my desk. They must be taking this quite seriously."

    "I can hear the person running down the hall right after, repeating the same phrase to the neighbors—“Orientation is starting in...”"

    "This must be a courtesy call from the RA. I’m in a hoodie I’ve worn since high school, but if today’s schedule is going to end so early, I can ease up on my personal dress code. "

    "I spend a few minutes getting ready in front of the bathroom mirror. I live in the suites, so each room has its own bathroom connected to it instead of the usual communal bathroom on each floor. I consider myself lucky."

    "I make my way down the several flights of stairs to the ground floor of the dorm. The elevator was broken on my way up last night, and I don’t expect that to change. My dorm room is on the top floor, so making my way up and down is actually quite a trek."

    "I hustle through the final steps and into the building’s main lobby. I walk out of the large double doors and I make it to the courtyard of the dormitory unit."
