    scene bg bridge

    "With nothing else to do, I consider reading more news on my phone at the front of the school. I hang over the railing of the bridge, the \"pretty\" place Rosa showed me."

    "This day has gone by like a whirlwind. I’m sure everyone else is feeling the same. It’s so unreal compared to the predictable days of high school."

    "High school might as well have a punch card system to log hours. Meanwhile, the hours are just slipping by."

    "My eyes start to water in the middle of my daydream and nostalgia. I notice a heavy smell before I notice that smoke is rising from the little creek below the bridge. The dark, pitch of tobacco clouds on an otherwise clear day."

    "There’s no smoking allowed on campus, anywhere. That much I know."

    "My head is over the railing but the smell is not to be betrayed. This is only the second strongest smell I’ve experienced today."

    "I hear a voice trailing from the smoker under the bridge. There’s lots of coughing in between."

    d "You owe me BIG TIME. Do you know how much my day has sucked because of you—"

    d "—with the worst damn hangover-"

    d "—had to run all the way to the library to get those printouts—"

    d "—put money in my school account for the first time in three years—"

    d "—spout out some bullshit about our school’s history—"

    d "—because you were still too damn drunk!"

    "I continue to listen, letting my curiosity get the better of me."

    d "No, only one. They waited that whole time ever since you called me to clean up your mess."

    d "Ugh."

    d "This is your fault."

    "I hear her voice in between coughing and hacking."

    d "You don’t really mean that."

    "What on earth is going on down there?"

    d "FINE! Fuck you!"

    "After a few seconds of leaves rustling in the wind, the largest cloud of smoke bustles its way up from under the bridge. The smell is really starting to get to me."

    d "Just… just call me later."

    "She stops talking and the smoke continues to pile up. I can only guess that she’s already hung up. I hear one, tiny sob from below."

    "I move away from the bridge’s side. I don’t think I should have heard that."

    "When Rosa walked away just a few minutes ago, she headed left from the bridge."

    "It’s none of my business, I tell myself. None of my business at all. She’s just an orientation leader. Just another student in a sea of forty thousand."

    "But I thought she was cool. Parts of the conversation I just heard drift through my mind. What’s eating her so much?"

    "I take a left at the end of the bridge. I’m curious if that’s the way to get down to the bed of the creek."

    "The greenery that Rosa disappeared behind has a small clearing between two bushes, but it’s well-hidden under the mass of trees."

    "I wouldn’t have noticed this place at all if there wasn’t a bundle of white papers fluttering on the ground. The path leads downward."

    "It’s Rosa’s papers from earlier, they’re still folded but starting to get dirty on the ground. They must have fallen out."

    "I let a sigh heave from my chest. She might need them."

    "Or is that just an excuse to get myself to walk through these bushes?"

    "I pick up Rosa’s papers on my way down."

    "There’s not much down here but litter, the trickling of running water, dying forestation, and a tall, blonde girl puffing her way through a box of cigarettes. She’s leaning on the concrete of the bridge’s underside."

    "Rosa is clutching the pack in her left hand like a juice box, a childish wraparound of her slender fingers, squeezing the life out of it."

    "A cigarette, half-burned with a fiery orange tip is resting between her lips. She’s contemplative but definitely more angry than anything else."

    "She immediately notices my presence as I crash through some branches."

    d "Looks like you found me."

    "Each time she speaks, the cigarette bobs up and down in her mouth, following the syllables in her voice."

    "Rosa laughs while tidying her jeans."

    d "I’m bad."

    "My hands are shaky. I’ve never been in this position before. Her hand on the cigarette box is shaking a little too. She’s crushing it."

    d "How much of that did you hear?"

    "She puffs smoke from out of her nose like an angry dragon. She certainly knows how to keep up appearances."

    p "I heard the end of it, at least."

    p "I’m sorry."

    "Rosa doesn’t even give me a moment’s notice before speaking again. Her voice is calm but with her shaking fist around the box, I can tell that’s not the case."

    d "You haven’t just found me, you’ve caught me."

    "Rosa laughs."

    d "Red-handed, scene of the crime, screaming bloody murder."

    d "My… partner is your actual leader. They practiced this for weeks."

    d "And then they got wrecked at a party last night."

    "That’s even more irresponsible than I thought. Rosa just doesn’t look like the type to get caught up in it."

    d "Don’t blame them, though. They’re getting destroyed by summer classes right now. A lot of technicals."

    d "Anyway. It’s still my responsibility to clean up after that mess."

    d "I can at least keep it together the next day afterward."

    "She kicks at the dirt on the ground."

    d "Have you had your first drink yet? Not the religious setting or sip at a barbeque crap."

    "I haven’t yet. I always played “the good child” even in high school."

    p "Never."

    "Rosa nods and hums a little tune, obviously entertained by my innocence."

    d "You’re still a freshman, I guess."

    d "But you’re definitely going to be asked that while you’re here. At least that’s out of the way."

    d "A few hours is pretty fast to be asked that, though. Or you’re unlucky to have me for a substitute!"

    "She makes herself laugh. At least she knows how to put herself in a good mood."

    "Especially after what I saw a few minutes ago."

    "She puts her box of cigarettes back into her pocket. That must be the object I saw earlier."

    d "Unlucky. You must have stepped on a seal on your way here."

    d "Haha!"

    "She paces around but she seems done with smoking for now. I’m still standing nearby, clutching her stack of papers. She has a grin on her face now."

    d "Moving on! I don’t like to dwell too long on my woes. You did well to come down here. Very brave!"

    d "You’re a bit quiet, huh?"

    "I admit that I haven’t said much, but I’ve been on one hell of a ride since this conversation started. Rosa’s makeshift tour confused me before, but it finally makes sense."

    "It didn’t feel right then. I should have trusted myself more."

    p "This is just a bit unexpected. You looked like any other senior college student to me just a while ago."

    "Rosa nods. She straightens out her collar to emphasize that clean and dapper appearance."

    d "Dig a bit deeper and you get to something that us English majors call substance. You learn some hefty words in 101."

    d "But I do admit that I’m a weirdo when it comes to my peers."

    d "Screw \'em."

    "She points around at the tangled ivy falling off of the side of the bridge, and the mucky water, and her own discarded cigarettes."

    d "I like it down here. Up there, it’s so stiff. So many pairs of eyes beaming at you."

    d "Sometimes, I feel like I’m wearing camouflage. I try to dress nice to make up for… this."

    d "Sheer and utter degeneracy."

    "She takes the cigarette out of her mouth and twirls it in her hand. It points to her chest on its final twirl."

    d "Appearances are important here, or else people will treat you differently. There’s a schoolwide tradition of “competition” here. Not from the students. From the whole damn business, head to toe."

    "This university is naturally competitive, of course. I haven’t been here long enough to discern how the students treat each other, though. Cora and Vi were friendly, they weren’t sizing me up."

    "Rosa points the burning end of her cigarette up towards the bridge. Then she turns back to me."

    d "What are your goals here? What are you majoring in?"

    p "I don’t know yet. I’m still undeclared."

    "Rosa’s face doesn’t change at all. She’s still taking the occasional puff, and above all, her posture is poor and quite relaxed."

    d "Ahhh. Mmmhmm."

    d "And how do you feel saying that out loud?"

    p "It’s not the first time today."

    "I’ve said it several times these past few hours. It seems like every student wants to know what I’m majoring in—I guess it’s a natural subject on the college campus."

    "But in the handful of times I’ve said, it, I’ve hesitated."

    p "It’s not the best feeling."

    d "See what I mean? This university just happens to collect people like you. Freaking out about your goals and aspirations even on your first day."

    d "It could still be there on your last day."

    d "My advice is to not stress about it. It’s all another campus game being played, like those seals."

    d "Who’s better than who. What to avoid and when. What matters and what doesn’t. No substance, just measurements."

    d "And then there’s that bell tower in the middle of campus."

    "She finally puts the cigarette back between her lips and takes a drag."

    d "Do you like it down here, too?"

    "I’m not uncomfortable, but this is all new to me. I’ve never touched this substance before."

        d "I need to get back and have this orientation sorted. The other students might actually expect some greatness out of me."

        "I follow her and notice the box still protruding from the pocket of her jeans. She wants to keep it a secret. I don’t mind it, but how much of it is a secret?"

        d "...I don’t mind the quiet ones, you know."

        "After my talk with Rosa, we were ushered into the gym and got an earful from the school administration; the Chancellor was not in attendance."

        "There were a few murmurs in the gym about his disappearance stemming from his recent media scandal, but I didn’t pay much attention."
