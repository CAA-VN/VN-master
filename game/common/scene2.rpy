    "The square connects each separate building unit, with a large bicycle cage in the center and a few wooden benches spread around its rectangular perimeter."

    "I’m not much of a morning person, but it was a good thing that I fixed my sleeping schedule before coming here. It’s still summer weather and the sun is shining brightly, though it’s not helping with the cold air."

    "The weather is a lot different from home. Even with the sun up and shining, there’s a bay nearby that brings in a chilly breeze, easing up the temperature but still sending down a shiver in the morning."

    "I look around my surroundings, but no one seems to be left outside in the courtyard, even though I just saw them en masse from my room. Don’t tell me I’m also late for orientation..."

    "It is at that moment that I hear the faint sound of the clock tower chiming along in the background."

    "*Chime*"
    
    "The chimes of the clock tower confirm my fears. It’s already nine o’clock."

    "I try to remember the assigned meeting place of my orientation group but nothing comes to mind. Pulling out my smartphone, I open the email that tells me to proceed to Sather Gate and locate orientation Group 6."

    "I survey the courtyard once more, hoping to find some clue to guide me to my destination. But the courtyard still looks as empty as before."

    "Suddenly, I hear a bright voice behind me."

    v "Sorry I’m late, Cora! I just had to double check I had everything!"
    
    "I turn my head toward the voice to see someone bound out of the dorm building I just exited. Accompanying the lively voice from behind me was the resounding thud of a shutting door and a quick shuffle of steps. I see a petite girl in a dark blue sweater and denim jeans jog past me, the messy bun of dark brown locks bouncing atop her head to the rhythm of her heeled boots. "

    "The girl leaps over to the bike cage and stops in front of no one. I step to the side to get a better angle, which reveals a girl with a blue hooded jacket and sweatpants who had originally been obscured by a pole."

    "The one who rushed past me stands shorter than the other, even with her heels."

    "The shorter girl rambles on excitedly, her arms widely gesturing. I strain my ears to hear snippets of their conversation."
    
    v "...packed extra water… bandaids…"
    
    "I watch her count on her fingers. It sounds like she’s listing things that she’s bringing along, but it seems rather overkill for orientation."
    
    v "...made sure… door was locked…"
    
    "Her mention of the door gives me pause for a moment. Did I lock my dorm door before I left?"

    "The taller girl keeps nodding instead of giving verbal responses, all while staring at her smartphone."

    "I hear a rustle to my left. Looking in that direction, I notice a squirrel scurrying toward an acorn on the ground. I look back at the two girls and watch the taller girl make eye contact with me. She taps the shorter girl and gestures in my direction."

    "The shorter girl stops mid-sentence, turns back, and notices me. She’s all smiles as she walks up to me while the taller girl follows behind."
    
    scene bg c_v_meetup_cg
    
    "As they approach me, I notice the shorter girl’s sweater has a cute golden bear mascot on it. She waves excitedly as she advances. The taller girl behind her has long unruly black hair and wears a comfy blue hoodie over a t-shirt with a tech logo on it. She holds her smartphone in one hand and brings the other up towards her mouth, attempting to cover up a yawn."
    
    v "Hey, are you heading to orientation too?"

    p "...Oh, yeah! Do you know where we’re supposed to meet?"
    
    v "Should be The Gate, right? We can walk there with you, since our orientation group is meeting there too."
    
    "The two look friendly enough. I immediately accept the offer, knowing I wouldn’t able to get to the orientation area alone."
    
    p "Sure!"
    
    scene bg street
    
    "The three of us leave the unit courtyard in what I assume is the direction of campus. Even though we’re already late, the two girls take their time walking and pointing out the different buildings."

    "Why aren’t they going faster if they know we’re late? I had to say something."
    
    p "Hey, you know we’re gonna be late if we don’t hurry, right?"
    
    v "Huh? We should still be fine."
    
    "She stares at me with a confused look on her face and her head tilted."
    
    p "But the bell tower already chimed 9 o’clock, so aren’t we late?"
    
    v "Wait, you don’t know?"
    
    p "Know what?"
    
    v "Hmm, I thought everybody knew about Bell Time."
    
    p "What time?"
    
    v "Bell Time. You can basically show up ten minutes late to anything here, and you’d still be on time."
    
    "Ten minutes, huh. That would have been nice during high school, when I had to rush from class to class. I hope I don’t abuse the privilege."
    
    p "Wow, I didn’t know about that. That sounds really convenient!"
    
    v "Yeah. The school uses it because classes start and end on the hour. People with back-to-back classes need time to get to their classrooms, so every class starts ten minutes after. "
    
    v "Then it kinda spread to other events and now it’s sort of tradition here."
    
    "Interesting. Though I feel like it’ll lead to the start of some bad habits…"
    
    "But it’s nice that the university has this. It shows that people are so busy moving from building to building that they feel the extra time is necessary. That or the campus is too big."
    
    "I probably have to learn about these traditions at some point. It feels as though there are a million more to learn. But I guess that’s what the orientation is for."
    
    "I look around the street. This is where I’m going to spend the next four years, so there isn’t a huge rush to soak up everything around me."
    
    "Though it’s a lot… dirtier than I expected. In front of abandoned storefronts, there are bands of homeless people strewn about. Some of them are standing while holding a cup, begging pedestrians for spare change. Most of them have cardboard signs of some sort, another plea for whatever change passersby could spare."

    v "So…"
    
    "I stop glancing around to turn to the short girl staring at me expectantly."
    
    v "Is this your first time in the city?"
    
    "I stare at her for a few seconds after hearing the sudden question. Regaining my composure, I answer back."

    p "Is it that obvious?"
    
    "She smiles at the affirmation, continuing her leisurely pace down the busy street."
    
    v "Only a little. If you had been here before, you’d know where The Gate is."
    
    "She watches me for a moment. I get the feeling I’m being analyzed like a test subject."
    
    v "And you wouldn’t look so lost at all these intersections."
    
    "Do I look lost? It’s true that I was looking at all of the signs on the street, but I did my best to stare straight ahead and not look like a new freshman."

    p "So does that mean you have been here before? Since you seem to know where you’re going."
    
    v "Just once. I came here on Bell Day."
    
    "Oh yeah, Bell Day. Basically an open house event that the university hosts every April for newly admitted students and their families. I remember I couldn’t go because my parents didn’t want me to miss any school."
    
    "Though in hindsight, learning about my new environment would’ve probably been better than learning about the environment in geography class…"
    
    "As if able to read my mind, the girl pipes up with a useful piece of advice."
    
    v "Just in case you get lost in the future, you can just type in the name of the building you’re trying to get to into the map app on your phone. It doesn’t always show you the shortest route, but it’s usually pretty accurate!"
    
    "I’m definitely going to need that on the first day of classes. I haven’t even heard of the names of the buildings around campus."
    
    "We came to a stop at a crosswalk when the shorter girl suddenly turned to me."
    
    v "Oh, I completely forgot to introduce myself! Sorry about that."
    
    "She turned toward me and smiled straight at me with her hand out."
    
    v "My name’s Violet, but just call me Vi! That’s what most people do."
    
    "Violet, huh? That’s a unique name. Though I’ve never heard of Vi being used as a nickname for Violet, I’ll just go with it since she seems casual about it."
    
    p "Nice to meet you."
    
    "I shake her outstretched hand. Vi motions to the taller girl, who was lurking behind us the entire time."
    
    v "And this is Cora."
    
    c "...Hey."
    
    p "Yo."
    
    "An awkward pause starts as Cora retreats back to her spot behind us. Vi frowns slightly for the first time since I met her, but reverts back quickly to her usual smile and turns back to me."
    
    v "Sorry, she doesn’t really talk too much."
    
    "I can see that. Cora’s face is glued to her phone screen, though she does occasionally raise her head and look in the direction of our conversation."
    
    p "So, how do you two know each other?"
    
    v "Well, we’re roommates."
    
    "She beams at Cora before turning back to watch the crosswalk light."
    
    p "I see."
    
    "Quite an interesting pair to be roommates. But you know what they say, opposites attract."
    
    "Having finished our introductions, we continue walking toward campus. Along the way, I took note of all the restaurants we walked past. Middle Cat. Neptune. Milkplate. Chez Essinap. "
    
    "Most of the restaurants have banners advertising good food at cheap prices:"
    
    "Lunch Combo! Footlong sandwich, chips, and medium drink for $7!"
    
    "Get the New Ultimate Burrito for only $6!"
    
    "These restaurants are obviously catering to us poor college kids."
    
    "I have meal points for the dining hall though, so I might as well go there for food since it’s part of my tuition anyway."
    
    "Well... it’s not a bad idea to visit a few of these places for a change of pace every once in a while."
    
    "We pass by a plaza-like area surrounded by a handful of restaurants in a U-shape. On a cursory glance, there seems to be around ten restaurants in the plaza. "
    
    "The air is filled with smells of different kinds of food––Pizza, curry, and ramen combining into an intense aroma that made my stomach grumble."
    
    "In the center are rows of tables and benches where people are eating their food. The whole area is packed with people waiting in line or walking around, deciding where to eat."
    
    p "Wow, there’s a lot of people here."
    
    v "Oh, yeah, that’s Italian Ghetto. I heard there are a bunch of good places to eat here. Have you been here yet, Cora?"
    
    c "Not yet."
    
    v "Hmm, okay. We’ll have to come sometime later then!"
    
    "Italian Ghetto… the name makes sense. More than half of the restaurants look like they serve pizza and pasta."
    
    "Upon closer observation, I notice that only a few of the restaurants had lines extending beyond the door, while others had merely one or two patrons sitting inside, if any. "
    
    "The area itself isn’t very fancy. The few trash cans in the plaza are filled to the brim with plastic containers, with some surrounded by litter on the ground. There are plenty of pigeons scavenging for scraps, just as many as the customers sitting down to enjoy their meals."
    
    "That aside, the area seems quite popular, considering the number of people here. I wonder what the prices are like. If the signs from before are any indication, they’ll probably be cheap."
    
    "We continue at our pace when we suddenly heard a loud Heck yeah!"
    
    p "Whoa!"

    v "Whoa!"
    
    p "Where did that come from?"
    
    v "I think it came from over there."
    
    "She points in the direction of the street corner, where a disheveled man sits in front of a Malblue’s"
    
    p "It was probably him, then. Looks like he’s homeless."
    
    v "Oh, I’ve heard about the homeless population here. Most of them are harmless as long as you keep to yourself."
    
    p "Wow, you’re pretty knowledgeable about the area."
    
    "Vi shrugs and falls silent for a moment. She glances down at her feet instead of keeping her gaze focused forward. There’s definitely a moment of hesitation before she responds."
    
    v "My cousin used to go here. She wouldn’t stop talking about the city ever since I got my own acceptance letter. My family can be intense."
    
    "Before I can ask any further, she precludes the chance with a short laugh, either amused or exasperated." 
    
    "She returns to her smiley self in mere moments, continuing down the sidewalk with a bounce in her step."
    
    "I’m surprised at the number of homeless people there are. For being the number one public university in the country, the surrounding city sure is pretty dirty. The sidewalks are all in poor condition too."
    
    "I noticed it a bit when I was moving into my dorm room, but I was more focused on moving in back then. Walking around the streets and now paying attention to my surroundings, I’m much more aware of it."
    
    v "Well, either way, it’s still a good idea to be careful. Right, Cora?"
    
    c "...Yeah."
    
    c "...Actually… I’ve heard about that man before."
    
    c "He’s called the ‘Heck Yeah’ guy because he screams it to people passing by."
    
    v "Really? That seems like it would be annoying."
    
    c "...Apparently it’s a tradition, though."
    
    "A screaming homeless guy is a tradition? Unless he breathes fire or something, I don’t really see a reason why."
    
    v "Wow, where did you hear that from?"
    
    c "...From the school forum. I saw a thread about it while I was looking up EECS requirements."
    
    v "Oh, right! I forgot to ask!"
    
    "Vi turns in my direction, eyes brimming with curiosity."
    
    v "What’s your major?"
    
    p "Actually... I still haven’t decided yet."
    
    "Vi was silent for a few seconds. Her usual smile falters slightly, and she looks at me with serious eyes, analyzing me and thinking about what to say next."
    
    v "I see."
    
    v "Well, you still have a lot of time."
    
    "I jumped a bit in surprise at the serious tone of her voice. Her cheerful demeanor was instantly replaced with a more distant and cold attitude."
    
    "I should probably ask what her major is. Might as well get used to asking, since I’m gonna do it a lot in the next few years."
    
    p "And what about you?"
    
    v "Molecular and Cellular Biology. I’m pre-med."
    
    "Pre-med, huh? Only one thing that really leads to…"
    
    p "...So you want to be a doctor, then?"
    
    v "Something like that."
    
    "An instant reply. Somebody knows what they want to be. I’m jealous."
    
    "It must be nice to have a solid idea of your future. I doubt if I’ll be that person anytime soon."
    
    "After all, I’m undeclared right now. I wish I could spout out an answer right here and now, but I can’t."
    
    "I bite another bullet and look over my shoulder to Cora, still tapping away at her phone."
    
    p "What’s your major, Cora?"
    
    "Cora replies while looking at her phone."
    
    c "...I’m EECS."
    
    "EECS… that’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. It’s one of the most popular majors here, and more and more students are applying to it each year."
    
    "I’m not the best with technology, but I was interested in programming during high school…"
    
    v "Cora is hella smart, if you end up taking CS 61A, you should definitely study with her."
    
    p "Oh, is that an introductory computer science class?"
    
    "Cora looks up from her phone the moment I said the words computer science."
    
    v "I heard a lot of people take the class."
    
    p "Oh yeah. I’ve overheard conversations from other freshmen that the class size was over 2000 people."
    
    c "...It is."
    
    "Cora suddenly jumps into the conversation, without Vi as a buffer."
    
    p "I wonder why they don’t just offer two iterations of the class."
    
    c "...Budget limits."
    
    c "They don’t have enough money to hire TAs and all that."
    
    "Ah yes, the struggle of public schools: money. I’m surprised Cora knows this much about the school already, just like Vi. Should I have done more research myself?"
    
    "All I did was relax after graduation until I got here."
    
    p "You know a lot about the EECS department already."
    
    c "I’ve been doing a lot of research on EECS. I wanted to know more about the program."
    
    "Her face softens for a moment, dropping her usual lack of enthusiasm. For the first time since we met, she stares directly into my eyes while putting her phone in her pocket."
    
    c "I love programming, after all."
    
    "It’s like I’m staring at Vi instead of Cora. Her sudden enthusiasm was matched with a warm smile. Maybe there’s more to her than meets the eye..."
    
    "Amazing how a simple computer science class can make a person seem so different."
    
    "Speaking of classes..."
    
    p "What classes are you taking, Vi?"
    
    v "Oh, mostly technicals for my major. Stuff like Biology 1B."
    
    p "Hmm, interesting."
    
    p "Why is it 1B, is there a 1A or something?"
    
    v "Oh, so Biology 1B is more ecology, plant biology and evolution, whereas 1A is human physiology and systems. 1B is supposed to be easier, and it doesn’t have any prerequisites."
    
    "Huh, seems kinda strange that a pre-med student needs to take a class about plants. But it doesn’t sound particularly boring, and it might be cool to try something new."
    
    v "So… what classes are you taking?"
    
    "It’s embarrassing to admit I still don’t know what classes I’m taking, especially since there are only a few days before enrollment. Should I tell the truth?"
    
    "Not only am I undeclared, I’m also just bouncing around basic graduation requirement classes until I take something more solidified..."

  v "Oh, that’s Sprout Plaza over there! And further down is Sather Gate, where we need to be."

  "The plaza is lined with two rows of small trees. Sure enough, looking further there is a tall gate-like structure where the majority of the crowd was gathered. I presume that’s Sather Gate."

  "Though it’s hard to see with the number of people around the area. To the left of the plaza is a tall building with a sign stating STUDENT UNION."
